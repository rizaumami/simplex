v0.4

- Replace custom font in Main Menu by embeded one (InfoFont).
  InfoFont is the same font (Xbox Book) with the custom but in smaller size.
  Custom font is Xbox Book 17 and InfoFont is xboxbook 14.
- Now, Main Menu is smaller so I think it would be better if tags also smaller
  than Main Menu. Now tags using SmallFont (xboxbook 12).
- Enable Scroll in Menu to accomodate long game's title. Now active menu with
  long name will scroll right to left.
- Rename SMPTE Color Bars to SMPTE Color Bars 75 as it's a 75% intensity variant.
- Smaller Icon.jpg. Compressed using yoga. Picture quality probably shit on big
  screen, but it's looks good enough on my 21" CRT TV.
- Bring back Shape to give cover art border as it's simpler than edit Icon.jpg
  to give it border.

- Remove Shape and use slightly bigger cover art image to create pseudo border.
- Simplify Menu code by letting UnleashX to manage main menu by using Position
  instead of ItemPos. This has side effect of narrower menu items line.
- Remove line defining unused font.

v0.2
2023-01-08 10:37:35

- Add Grid skin to calibrate CRT's geometry.
  This grid is a copy of 240p grid from 240pTestSuite.
  At first I want 480 version but the UnleashX can't display it properly.
  Perhaps it's a limitation of its XML parser.
- Add SMPTE Color Bars (75) to calibrate CRT's colours.
- Change SNTP server to time.google.com.
